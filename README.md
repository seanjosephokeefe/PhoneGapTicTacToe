# PhoneGapTicTacToe

Here is a project that started out as an extra credit assignment for a mobile app development class I was teaching.

It's a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game. 

The game is HTML5, JavaScript and JQuery. 

I built it in Visual Studio. You can upload the VS project right to PhoneGap after you zip it up.

I've also included a folder named HTML that only has the source files without all of the added Visual Studio stuff.
